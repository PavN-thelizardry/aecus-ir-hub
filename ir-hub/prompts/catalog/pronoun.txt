Task:
Perform a pronoun usage analysis across the corpus.

1. Count raw frequencies of:
   - First-person collective: we, us, our
   - First-person singular: I, me, my
   - Third-person plural: they, them, their
2. Provide totals per document (doc_id).
3. For transcripts, attribute counts separately by speaker if labels exist.
4. Provide 5–10 verbatim snippets where usage clearly signals cultural stance.
5. Interpret:
   - Balance of internal (“we/I”) vs external (“they”).
   - What this suggests about locus of control and cultural positioning.
